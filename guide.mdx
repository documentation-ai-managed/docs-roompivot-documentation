## Optimizing Photo Uploads

Upload high-quality photos to achieve the best AI-generated redesigns. Use well-lit images with minimal obstructions for accurate room detection and transformation.

<Callout kind="tip">
Capture photos from multiple angles during walkthroughs. Aim for natural lighting between 10 AM and 4 PM to avoid harsh shadows.
</Callout>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Prepare the Room" icon="camera">
    Clear clutter and ensure even lighting. Shoot at eye level for natural perspectives.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose Resolution" icon="maximize">
    Select images at least 1024x768 pixels. Higher resolutions yield finer details in redesigns.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Upload and Generate" icon="upload">
    Drag and drop into RoomPivot dashboard. Select style presets like "Modern Minimalist" for quick iterations.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Integrating with Real Estate Listings

Embed RoomPivot redesigns directly into MLS listings, Zillow pages, or your website to showcase "after" visuals alongside existing photos.

<CodeGroup tabs="HTML,JavaScript">
```html
<iframe 
  src="https://app.roompivot.com/embed/YOUR_PROJECT_ID" 
  width="100%" 
  height="500"
  frameborder="0">
</iframe>
```

```javascript
const embed = document.createElement('iframe');
embed.src = 'https://app.roompivot.com/embed/YOUR_PROJECT_ID';
embed.width = '100%';
embed.height = '500';
embed.frameBorder = '0';
document.getElementById('room-preview').appendChild(embed);
```
</CodeGroup>

<Callout kind="success">
Replace `YOUR_PROJECT_ID` with the shareable ID from your RoomPivot project dashboard.
